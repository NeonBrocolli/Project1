#i. Spin to Win!
Spin to win is a slot machine simulator. Everything from making bets to pulling levers, to hitting the machine. It is a game of chance and testing your luck!

Informally called the fruit machine, the slot machine is a casino gambling machine with usually three or more reels.  When a lever/button is activated it will spin a set of images that line up within the three reels. The machine will pay off according to the patterns of symbols that line up when the machine stops spinning. If all the patterns are the same the return is what the player had bet and some.

Slot machines are also known as one-armed bandits because they were originally operated by one lever on the side of the machine as distinct from a button on the front panel, and because of their ability to leave the player in debt and impoverished. (wiki)
