    <h3>&diams; Instructions: &diams;</h3>
        <p>To begin the player must make a bet using their pool of credits. Below are choices of bets between five, ten and all in.
        <br><br>
        After making a bet the player can spin the reels using either the spin button or the lever for a chance to win more credits.
        <br><br>
        The reels will then show randomized images and in order to win, the reels must have matching images.
        <br><br>
        The player will recieve partial wins if only two match on one side or the other.
        If the player doesn't get a match and have no more credits the game ends :(. Test your luck!

        <p>Disclaimer! I do not promote gambling nor do I condone it. I am not a gambler nor am I good at it.
        <br>
        I thought this game would be fun to make for the first time as it involves many moving parts stylistically and functionally.
        This game was a product FOR SCIENCE!
        <br><br>
        I hope you have fun playing this game as much as I had fun making it.
        Feel free to contact me for any questions, comments or concerns!
